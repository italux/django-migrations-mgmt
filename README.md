## Getting Started

This is a [fork](https://gist.github.com/italux/1fe473c5d05da496e09a4d23b12857cf) of [Jc2k's](https://gist.github.com/Jc2k) [work](https://gist.github.com/Jc2k/bacff3105653f3b28e84), where I've made small fixes, build and distribuite as a pypi package

> The idea here is that if you know which migrations were in version 2.0.3 of your project and which were in version 2.0.4 then setA - setB gives you the list of migrations you need to undo. See [Design Implementation](docs/design_implementation.md) document.

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.7
- Django >= 2.2

### Install
```sh
pip install django-migrations-mgmt
```

### Usage

- Add to django `settings.py`
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'migrations_mgmt_cmds',
    ...
]
...
# Inform the class' path that handle storage's backend
MIGRATIONS_RELEASES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage'
...
```

- Create a migration release
```sh
python manage.py migrations_release --release v0.1
```
- Check the release JSON file in your storage backend
```sh
ls
v0.1.json
```
- Create a new migration
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'sample_app':
  sample_app/migrations/0002_choice.py
    - Create model Choice
```
- Execute pending migrations
```sh
python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sample_app, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying sample_app.0002_choice... OK
```
- Rollback the last applied migration
```sh
python manage.py migrations_rollback --release v0.1
Operations to perform:
  Revert sample_app 0002_choice
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Unapplying sample_app.0002_choice... OK
```
- Check applied migrations
```sh
python manage.py showmigrations
```

## Important Notes

### Storage's Backend

The storage's backend to be used can be informed passing a class' path to the setting `MIGRATIONS_RELEASES_STORAGE`, in case it isn't informed, the value set-up at Django's setting `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` will be used instead.

You should inform the path as python package, e.g. `'path.Classname'`

### Known Issues

It's quite common to change the database level constraints - for example to suddenly allow NULL data - which you'll almost certainly end up with data that doesn't satisfy this constraint, and consequenctly any attempt to revert will fail. Similar problems existing when changing the size of a field.

So relying on this as a strategy for backing our changes is risky! More testing should be added.

### Recomendations & Tips

To avoid the rollback issues mentioned above please check the [Django Migrations Good Practices](docs/migrations_good_practices.md) documentation
